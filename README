## Note

* All requests are protected by IP-based rate limiting. Exceeding the limit will result in a block.
* The POST method must be used with all requests except for the get_address_by_uuid endpoint, which uses GET.

Please ensure your request payloads are structured correctly and that all required data is included. If you are unsure of the proper formatting or if you encounter an error, please refer to the specific endpoint details above.

Always check the HTTP status code and message included in the server response to confirm the result of your request. Successful requests will return a 200 status code, while unsuccessful requests will return an error code and message.

## Status Codes

* 200: Success
* 400: Bad Request (Client Error)
* 404: Not Found
* 429: Too Many Requests (Rate Limit Exceeded)
